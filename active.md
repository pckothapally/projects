# Active Projects

Our weekly meetups are every [Thursday at 7pm ET](/io/coders/).

Select one of the 7 project areas below and add your first name below by editing a [fork of the projects repo](https://github.com/ModelEarth/projects/blob/main/active.md), then send a PR.

**Active OPT Volunteers:** If you're participacting as an OPT grad, please contribute at least one Pull Request (PR) per week to remain active.  

Please actively update README files. Add status updates and deployment steps, correct existing notes. Send an email whenever you send a pull request. If you are uncertain about an edit, make your best guess and submit the PR anyway. Include any uncertainties in the email you send after submitting the PR.

[Fork and clone related repos](../localsite/start/steps/) - When writing, include a review link. Your review link will be: [youraccount].github.io/[therepo] once you've turned on Github Pages for both your fork of the repo and your fork of the [localsite repo](https://github.com/modelearth/localsite/).

You can [edit the current page](https://github.com/ModelEarth/projects/blob/main/active.md) to add your first name by the projects below, and add details for new updates.  
Also send an email whenever you submit a PR.

TO DO: Use our [cloud repo](https://github.com/ModelEarth/cloud) and add Flask deployment documentation. [Our webhook repo](https://github.com/ModelEarth/webhook) has Google Cloud Flask documentation to copy and update for your Flask hosting setup examples.


## 1. Javascript Data Visualization (JS)

Our [Everybody's Home Page](../home) process is being designed to display infinite content based on parameters.

IN PROGRESS: [Javascript Timelines from Google Data Commons API](/data-commons/docs/data/) - Priyanka<!--Mehul, Aishwrya, Vishnupriya-->

IN PROGRESS: Update our existing [address auto-lookup](../home/) to set state=NY etc. in the URL hash. (Currently visible on [localhost only](http://localhost:8887/home/).) - Jennifer(Jeni)

We're pulling images and video via [our FeedPlayer](https://model.earth/feed) which can be pointed at a Github repo or any API.

## 2. Planet Ai - Javascript with LLM APIs (AI)

[Planet AI Dev](/planet) within our [Planet Repo](https://github.com/modelearth/planet) for our Langchain JS.

Our [repo pull page](../home/repo) uses GitHub's API to load images, music and text to send to LLM APIs using javascript.

IN PROGRESS: Add javascript to our [Planet repo](https://github.com/modelearth/planet/) that uses [Langchain's Chat Model Interface](https://python.langchain.com/docs/concepts/chat_models/), send a page from any GitHUb repo to an AI API like OpenAI to provide Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) using [LangChain.js](https://api.js.langchain.com) javascript. - Dhananjay, Kelly, Adithya

TO DO: Integrate [our API storage in javascript](/localsite/tools/storage/api/) to store API keys locally.

TO DO: Pull SeeClickFix API and feed to Langchain

https://model.earth/feed/view/#feed=seeclickfix-311

Also, by choosing "SeeClickFix - v2" in the upper right dropdown menu images are displayed:

https://model.earth/feed

The Langchain API "planet" repo could identify 3 solvable issues in the SeeClickFix feed and provide cost estimates for resolving issues with the involvement of local contractors and government agencies.

**Python Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG)**

TO DO: Move Python Langchain into main branch in [Our Python Langchain Repo](https://github.com/modelearth/langchain/) <!--Dhananjay and Pranathi  -->

[Conversational RAG for 10 LLMs](https://python.langchain.com/docs/tutorials/qa_chat_history/) - Pradeep and Pranoy  

Pradeep: Pinecone on AWS free 2 GB max
Pranoy: DocArray in memory Vecto Store (database)

We can also [remove LangChain to simplify](https://www.octomind.dev/blog/why-we-no-longer-use-langchain-for-building-our-ai-agents)

**Retrieval-Interleaved Generation (RIG)**  
Using [Google Data Commons DataGemma AI](https://ai.google.dev/gemma/docs/datagemma) - For RIG, Zihan found that a paid Google plan was needed to avoid storage/memory errors/timeouts. Here's our [RIG CoLab](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1eLtHOR6e3lAUVijUJ56VMaiTU6hA9enc?usp=sharing).


### OpenWebUI LLM Location Data

Our [Open WebUI for Locations](location/) experimental efforts aimed at [Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG)](https://docs.openwebui.com/features/rag/) for "context window" recency.<!-- Next: Text to Action / Nividia Kuda is their advantage = code library that interacts with chip -->

TO DO: Try new Ollama omit command `ENABLE_OLLAMA_API=False` with Google Cloud. Hopefully we no longer need to develop our [Customize.py script](/projects/location/setup/customize/) to remove local use of Ollama. Nor our Sync.py script to add-back Ollama to sync with the [OpenWebUI parent repo](https://github.com/open-webui/open-webui).

TO DO: [Add localsite.js to OpenWebUI](/projects/location/) - steps for [Building Branches Locally](/projects/location/setup/) within a fork of the [Modelearth OpenWebUI fork (modelearthbranch)](https://github.com/ModelEarth/open-webui/tree/modelearthbranch)
